<h1>projects</h1>
<dl>
<dt><a href="https://github.com/hyphenc/startpage">&nbsp;startpage&nbsp;</a></dt>
<dd>My startpage with links to my favorite websites, date and time, the weather forecast and an image that's nice to look at. The searchbar is multifunctional (one might call it 'smart') and just behaves as one'd expect it to (i.e. accepts search queries, DuckDuckGo Bangs and URLs with and without the 'http[s]://' scheme). Also supports playing certain radio channels. The images served are all webp images to improve load time.</dd>
<dt><a href="https://github.com/hyphenc/mailserver">&nbsp;mailserver&nbsp;</a></dt>
<dd>A set of config files (with secure defaults AFAIK) for a mailserver running Postfix, Dovecot and Rspamd. Also contains a whole write-up of how to set it all up (including DNS, etc). I mainly wrote all this for myself to remember all the things involved, if I need to do it again. Currently I'm also running my own mailserver.</dd>
<dt><a href="https://github.com/hyphenc/vplan">&nbsp;vplan&nbsp;</a></dt>
<dd>A substitution plan scraper for a tool widely used by schools in Germany. The 'official' way to use said tool was annoying and a popular (3rd party) app that popped up a little later was ehh. Thus I wrote my own tool. The 'backend' is basically a bash script that does some heavy regex matching and edits some html files served by nginx, while the 'frontend' is mainly javascript logic like sorting by date, hiding old items and a filtering engine that supports regexes.</dd>
<dt><a href="https://github.com/hyphenc/mradio">&nbsp;mradio&nbsp;</a></dt>
<dd>A PWA-esque webpage for listening to different online radio stations/streams. UI is generated on-the-fly from a config file that contains info like the stream URL or thumbnails for each channel. It's called 'mradio' ('mobile radio') because it was originally intended for mobile phones (the available apps weren't to my liking).</dd>
<dt><a href="https://github.com/hyphenc/huec">&nbsp;huec&nbsp;</a></dt>
<dd>A program to control your Philips Hue lights, written in C. Configuration is done in a minimalistic way, using just plain ol' header files. Apart from changing power-on state, brightness, hue, saturation (etc.), registering with the Hue Bridge API, getting info about a light from that API as well as setting predefined profiles (aka scenes) is also supported.</dd>
<dt><a href="https://github.com/hyphenc/remotelockd">&nbsp;remotelockd&nbsp;</a></dt>
<dd>A 'daemon' that listens on a local port and suspends the machine when it receives a valid, one-time token. Use case: when you go to the printer and forgot to lock your device.</dd>
<dt><a href="https://github.com/hyphenc/shelltwitch">&nbsp;shelltwitch&nbsp;</a></dt>
<dd>A CLI tool to check which streamers are online, what they're playing (etc) using the Twitch API. Sends desktop notifications when someone's gone live using notify-send and cron. Followed streamers are also pulled from the API.</dd>
<dt><a href="https://github.com/hyphenc/xpowerpredict">&nbsp;xpowerpredict&nbsp;</a></dt>
<dd>A Python script that tries to predict possible point loss/gain for an online multiplayer game called Splatoon 2. Spawns a window using Tkinter to display the calculated values, which sometimes aren't that accurate because the current formula tends to inflate results in special cases.</dd>
<dt><a href="https://github.com/hyphenc/iserv-aufgaben-rss">&nbsp;iserv-aufgaben-rss&nbsp;</a></dt>
<dd>A bash script that scrapes the exercises teachers give students from the school's I-Serv platform and generates an RSS feed from that.</dd>
<dt><a href="https://github.com/hyphenc/hyphenc.github.io">&nbsp;this website&nbsp;</a></dt>
<dd>An index of what I've done/am doing...</dd>

<h1>minor things</h1>
<dl>
<dt><a href="https://github.com/hyphenc/dotfiles">&nbsp;dotfiles&nbsp;</a></dt>
<dd>My linux dotfiles, scripts, etc.</dd>
<dt><a href="https://github.com/hyphenc/xdm-simple">&nbsp;xdm-simple&nbsp;</a></dt>
<dd>A minimal theme for XDM (X Display Manager) with a clock and buttons to reboot (etc). I (still) use XDM because it has been rather stable (last substantial change in the codebase was 13 yrs ago), is somewhat minimal and just works.</dd>
<dt><a href="https://github.com/hyphenc/sudoku-solver">&nbsp;sudoku-solver&nbsp;</a></dt>
<dd>A brute-force sudoku solver written in C.</dd>
<dt><a href="https://github.com/hyphenc/dotfiles/blob/master/.scripts/pldl">&nbsp;pldl&nbsp;</a></dt>
<dd>A bash script that downloads a Youtube playlist, tries to extract artist name and song title and encodes the video thumbnail in the final mp3. I used to use this for downloading music.</dd>
<dt><a href="https://gist.github.com/hyphenc/fc7d723b001c95250e73679a3da803fb/">&nbsp;youtube.css&nbsp;</a></dt>
<dd>A minimal UserCSS for Youtube.</dd>
<dt><a href="https://gist.github.com/hyphenc/c97d8d1765bdaabce768c891e684fe83">&nbsp;strawbot.py&nbsp;</a></dt>
<dd>A voting bot for strawpoll.de, I wrote this for fun.</dd>
<dt><a href="https://gist.github.com/hyphenc/fb7757fa678a25e7504eccd5d2c44515">&nbsp;hugendubel in stock&nbsp;</a></dt>
<dd>A bash script that checks if a book is in stock in the Hugendubel stores in your area. Uses their somewhat 'internal APIs' and sometimes doesn't work because of reCAPTCHA.</dd>
<dt><a href="https://gist.github.com/hyphenc/3e47e80311a76304a7fff56281059dc5">&nbsp;nc urlshare&nbsp;</a></dt>
<dd>A bash script that uploads a file to a nextcloud server, sets its sharing permissions to URL sharing and returns the URL.</dd>
<dt><a href="https://gist.github.com/hyphenc/432eabf4c403abdd0e51b33bd4962689">&nbsp;genbooklist.sh&nbsp;</a></dt>
<dd>Exports an Amazon wishlist (containing books, that's what it was made to do) to an html page. Downloads the cover and tries to extract book title and author, then presents all the data in a pretty, responsive css grid layout.</dd>
